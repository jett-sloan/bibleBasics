    "title": "Judah and Tamar",
    "summary": "Genesis 38 tells the story of Judah and Tamar. After the death of her husbands, Tamar disguises herself to ensure her rights are upheld. She becomes pregnant by Judah and is later vindicated when the truth is revealed.",

      {
        "question": "Why did Tamar disguise herself?",
        "answer": "Because Judah failed to give her his third son in marriage, she took matters into her own hands to carry on the family line."
      },
      {
        "question": "How did Judah react when he learned Tamar was pregnant?",
        "answer": "At first, he condemned her, but when he found out he was the father, he admitted she was more righteous than he."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why did Er's brother have to marry his wife after Er died?",
        "answer": "This was part of an ancient custom called 'levirate marriage.' If a man died without children, his brother was expected to marry the widow and have a child with her. That way, the dead brother’s name and family line could continue."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why did Onan think the child wouldn’t be his?",
        "answer": "Onan knew that the child would legally belong to his brother, not him. The child would carry Er’s name and get his inheritance. Onan didn’t want that, so he avoided having a child with Tamar."

      {
        "question": "Why does a veil over her face mean she’s a prostitute?",
        "answer": "In some ancient cultures, women who wore veils in public (especially near town entrances or special roads) were seen as temple or shrine prostitutes. Tamar used this disguise to hide who she was from Judah."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a signet, seal, and cord?",
        "answer": "A signet or seal was like a personal stamp used to sign documents. It was worn on a cord around the neck. It worked like a signature or ID, showing ownership or authority. Giving it away was like handing over your wallet and ID today."

      {
        "question": "What is a midwife?",
        "answer": "A midwife was a woman who helped other women give birth. They were important in times before hospitals and often helped with safe deliveries and newborn care."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why would God care about Judah's family line after he sold Joseph?",
        "answer": "God still chose to work through Judah even though he made big mistakes. This shows that God uses imperfect people for His plans. Later, Judah’s family line leads to King David—and eventually to Jesus. God’s grace is bigger than people’s failures."
