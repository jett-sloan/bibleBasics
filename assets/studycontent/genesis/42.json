      {
        "question": "Why didn’t Joseph tell his brothers who he was and why did he call them spies?",
        "answer": "Joseph wanted to test his brothers and see if they had changed since they sold him. By pretending to be a powerful stranger and accusing them of being spies, he could watch how they treated each other and find out if their hearts were different without revealing who he was right away."

        "question": "Who was held in Egypt as collateral?",
        "answer": "Simeon was kept while the others returned home to bring Benjamin."

        "question": "Are Jacob and Israel the same person?",
        "answer": "Yes! Jacob and Israel are the same man. God gave Jacob the name 'Israel' after a special moment in Genesis 32. Sometimes the Bible switches between the two names."

      {
        "question": "Why were the brothers talking through an interpreter?",
        "answer": "Joseph was speaking Egyptian, and the brothers spoke Hebrew. Even though Joseph understood them, he used an interpreter to keep his identity hidden from them."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why were the brothers scared when they saw the money in their bags?",
        "answer": "They thought they were in big trouble. It looked like they had stolen the grain without paying, even though Joseph secretly told his men to return the money. In that culture, stealing from a ruler could have serious consequences."
