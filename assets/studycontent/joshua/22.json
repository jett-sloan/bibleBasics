    "title": "Eastern Tribes Return Home",
    "summary": "Joshua 22 tells how the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh return to their land east of the Jordan. They build an altar by the Jordan, which nearly causes civil war, but they clarify it is a memorial, not for offerings.",

      {
        "question": "Why did the eastern tribes build an altar?",
        "answer": "As a witness to future generations that they share in the Lordâ€™s covenant, not as a separate place of worship."
      },
      {
        "question": "How was the conflict resolved?",
        "answer": "Through dialogue, the tribes explained their intention, and the rest of Israel accepted their explanation."
